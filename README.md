## TL;DR

Finamp is a **free** Jellyfin music player for Android, iOS and Desktop. It allows you to Stream and Download the music you own. It has a **modern design** that should feel familiar right-away, a few **customizations** and of course **privacy**!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **need** access to a [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) server or you **won't be able to use Finamp at all**.  
> ([Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/releases/tag/v0.64.0) and [Lyra](https://github.com/lyra-org/lyra) also work, but aren't actively supported)

## Features

Finamp comes with a bunch of features, but here are the ones we think are **most interesting**:

- Gapless playback
- Download music to listen offline
- Transcoded streaming for reduced mobile data usage
- Dynamic colors based on the current track & your device's theme
- Lyrics Support
- Audio volume normalization (aka "ReplayGain")
- Android Auto & CarPlay support
- Integration with [AudioMuse](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI) for sonic analysis and improved mixes
- [Desktop support](#other-installation-methods)
- Support for the tracking your listening via the [Playback Reporting](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/plugins/#playback-reporting) plugin, even when you are offline!
- *And more for you to explore, e.g. via [our Wiki](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/wiki)!*

## Installing Finamp

- Android:
  - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicornsonlsd.finamp)
  - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp/)
  - `.apk`: see the [GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/1.0.1)
- iOS:
  - [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finamp/id1574922594)
- Linux:
  - [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp)
  - [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/finamp)
- Windows:
  - `.msix`: see the [GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest)
  - `.zip` (for manual install): see the [GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest)
- macOS:
  - `.app`: see the [GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest)

#### Android

- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicornsonlsd.finamp)
- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp/)
- `.apk`: see the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest)

#### Windows

Since the app is not available via the Microsoft Store yet, you'll have to install a self-signed certificate before you can install the [`.msix` file attached to each release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest).
**You'll only have to do this once!**

1. Download the latest `.msix` file from the [release page](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/releases), then navigate to the folder you downloaded it to in File Explorer
2. Right-click the package and select *Properties*
3. **Properties**: Switch to the *Digital Signatures* tab, then select `Finamp` under *Signature list* (or *Embedded Signatures*), then click *Details*
4. **Digital Signature Details**: click *View Certificate*
5. **Certificate**: click *Install Certificate...*
6. **Certificate Import Wizard**: set *Store Location* to `Local Machine`, click *Next*, then *Place ... in the following store* and browse to `Trusted People`, then *Next* and *Finish*
7. You can now close all the popups and open the MSIX file to install it!

Alternatively, you could download the [plain zip archive](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest) and manually drag it into the correct place. This is however not a portable installation, since it will still create the database in your user directory.

#### Mac

- `.app`: see the [GitHub release](https://github.com/finamp-app/finamp/releases/latest)

#### Linux

- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp)
- [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/finamp)
  - Install via `yay -S finamp`

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you accept donations?

Contributions and donations of any kind are welcome, but you can't donate to *Finamp* directly. So, if you see some new feature or fix in the release notes that you like, feel free to check if *the person that contributed that* accepts donations!

### Which formats/codecs does Finamp support?

Most. Generally speaking if Jellyfin and your device support a format, Finamp will too! In case a format doesn't work you can always enable transcoding (Finamp can transcode lossless transcoding to FLAC!).

### Does Finamp support Android Auto / Apple CarPlay?

Yes! Both are supported, but if you want to use Android Auto, you'll have to install the app via the Play Store.

### Is Finamp legal?

Yes. Finamp is a *tool* that lets you interface with a Jellyfin server. Finamp does not come with any music, and will not connect to streaming services other than Jellyfin.  
You will need to bring your own media and add it to Jellyfin, by purchasing music online or ripping discs. This often also directly supports your favorite artists!

## Info For Advanced Users

### Dynamic Theming On Linux

On Linux, Finamp registers itself with the DBus system, which means you can send messages locally to Finamp!
This system allows you keep Finamp's color theme up to date with your dynamic color theme without restarting the app.
There are two color related "endpoints" you can call:

1. Reload the system accent color from GTK ([Settings > Layout & Theme > "Use System Accent"](https://intradeus.github.io/http-protocol-redirector?r=finamp://internal/settings/layout) needs to be *enabled*)

```sh
gdbus call \
    --session \
    --dest 'com.unicornsonlsd.FinampSettings' \
    --object-path '/com/unicornsonlsd/Finamp' \
    --method 'com.unicornsonlsd.Finamp.updateAccentColor'
```

1. Overwrite the accent color ([Settings > Layout & Theme > "Use System Accent"](https://intradeus.github.io/http-protocol-redirector?r=finamp://internal/settings/layout) needs to be *disabled*)  
  Only works when Finamp is running.

```sh
gdbus call \
    --session \
    --dest 'com.unicornsonlsd.FinampSettings' \
    --object-path '/com/unicornsonlsd/Finamp' \
    --method 'com.unicornsonlsd.Finamp.setAccentColor' \
    '#ff0000' # you can also send "default" to clear the accent color
```
